# Minesweeper

My solution for the Minesweeper coding challenge completed in Node, Typescript and React with all stretch goals completed. Built using strict TDD. All assets are pilfered directly from minesweeper.com which is why it looks so much like their version. I didn't pilfer the logic though! Also, the fact that you can hit a mine on your first click is a feature, not a bug. Life's not fair and neither is this game.

## How to run

`npm run start` and the app should run on http://localhost:3000 \
`npm run test` to run the tests \
Enjoy

## The Challenge

Before we take a break from grid-based challenges, your dastardly dare for this week is to recreate the logic behind the classic Minesweeper game. Given a grid of characters where each X represents a mine and each - represents empty space, the aim is to return a grid where each - is replaced by an integer indicating the number of mines adjacent to that spot (including diagonally). \
