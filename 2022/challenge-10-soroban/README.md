# Soroban

My solution for the Soroban coding challenge completed in Node, Typescript and React with all stretch goals completed.

## How to run

`npm run start` and the app should run on http://localhost:3000 \
`npm run test` to run the tests \
Enjoy

## The Challenge

A Japanese soroban is a type of abacus which is used by sliding beads up and down wires. A soroban is divided into an upper deck (where each bead is worth 5 units), and a lower deck (where each bead is worth 1 unit). To read the value of a soroban, for each wire we count the value of the beads that have been moved towards the dividing line on the upper and lower deck, adding the two together. If we use 'O' to represent a bead and '|' to represent the wires, the challenge is to write an algorithm capable of counting the value of any given soroban.

### Rewards:

:five: Points are awarded for a working algorithm. \
:three: Further points are awarded for providing a basic, interactive user interface with beads which can be manipulated. \
:two: Further points are awarded for providing a suite of unit tests. \
